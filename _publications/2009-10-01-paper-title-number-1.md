**Context.** We have been observing, thanks to ALMA, the dust distribution in the region of active planet formation around young
stars. This is a powerful tool that can be used to connect observations with theoretical models and improve our understanding of the
processes at play.

**Aims.** We want to test how a multiplanetary system shapes its birth disk and to study the influence of the planetary masses and particle
sizes on the final dust distribution. Moreover, we apply our model to the HL Tau system in order to obtain some insights on the
physical parameters of the planets that are able to create the observed features.

**Methods.** We follow the evolution of a population of dust particles, treated as Lagrangian particles, in two-dimensional locally
isothermal disks where two equal-mass planets are present. The planets are kept in fixed orbits and they do not accrete mass.

**Results.** The outer planet plays a major role in removing the dust particles in the co-orbital region of the inner planet and in forming
a particle ring which have a steeper density gradient close to the gap edge respect to the single-planet scenario, promoting the
development of vortices. The ring and gap width depend strongly on the planetary mass and particle stopping times, and for the more
massive cases on the ring clumps in few stable points that are able to collect a high mass fraction. The features observed in the HL Tau
system can be explained through the presence of several massive cores that shape the dust disk where the inner planet(s) have a mass
of the order of $0.07 M_{Jup}$ and the outer one(s) of the order of $0.35 M_{Jup}$. These values can be significantly lower if the disk mass turns
out to be less than previously estimated. By decreasing the disk mass by a factor of $10$, we obtain similar gap widths for planets with a
mass of $10 M_\oplus$ and $20 M_\oplus$ for the inner and outer planets, respectively. Although the particle gaps are prominent, the expected gaseous
gaps are barely visible.
