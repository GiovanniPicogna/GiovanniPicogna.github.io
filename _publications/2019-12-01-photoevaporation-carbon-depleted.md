The so-called transition discs provide an important tool to probe various mechanisms that might influence the evolution of protoplanetary discs and therefore the formation of planetary systems. One of these mechanisms is photo-evaporation due to energetic radiation from the central star, which can in principle explain the occurrence of discs with inner cavities like transition discs. Current models, however, fail to reproduce a subset of the observed transition discs, namely objects with large measured cavities and vigorous accretion. For these objects the presence of (multiple) giant planets is often invoked to explain the observations. In our work, we explore the possibility of X-ray photo-evaporation operating in discs with different gas-phase depletion of carbon and show that the influence of photo-evaporation can be extended in such low-metallicity discs. As carbon is one of the main contributors to the X-ray opacity, its depletion leads to larger penetration depths of X-rays in the disc and results in higher gas temperatures and stronger photo-evaporative winds. We present radiation-hydrodynamical models of discs irradiated by internal X-ray + EUV radiation assuming carbon gas-phase depletion by factors of three, 10, and 100 and derive realistic mass-loss rates and profiles. Our analysis yields robust temperature prescriptions as well as photo-evaporative mass-loss rates and profiles which may be able to explain a larger fraction of the observed diversity of transition discs.

The metallicity relation of Ercolano & Clarke (2010) is included as a reference. In contrast to their results, our relations predict a less extreme increase of the mass-loss rate with decreasing carbon abundance (metallicity).</figcaption>
