Education
======
* B.S. in Astronomy, University of Padua, 2006
* M.S. in Astronomy, University of Padua, 2010
* Ph.D in Sciences and Technologies for Aeronautics and Satellite Applications, CISAS (University of Padua), 2014

Work experience
======
* June 2014 - March 2016: post-doc
  * University of Tübingen
  * Duties included: I addressed the evolution of pebbles and small planetesimals in the protoplanetary nebula and their role in the buildup of giant planet’s core, by implementing a population of Lagrangian particles in two grid‐based hydro codes.
  * Supervisor: Wilhelm Kley

* April 2016 - current: post-doc
  * Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich
  * Duties included: I implemented a new model for the disc photo-evaporation by the high energetic stellar X‐ray irradiation, studying potential observable features and its role in the planet formation and evolution process.
  * Supervisor: Barbara Ercolano
