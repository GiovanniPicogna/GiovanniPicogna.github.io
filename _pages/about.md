About me
========

Welcome to my homepage.
Since April 2016 I am a post-doc at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München in the Star and Planet Formation group led by Barbara Ercolano

My current research focuses on dust evolution in protoplanetary discs and on transitional discs.

I am also interested in planet formation around binary star systems and on the influence of stellar fly-bys on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
