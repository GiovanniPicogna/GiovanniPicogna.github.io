About me
========

Welcome to my homepage!

Since April 2016 I am a post-doc at the [{`University Observatory`}](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) of the [Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit√§t](https://www.lmu.de) (Munich) in the Star and Planet Formation group led by [Barbara Ercolano](https://ercolano4.wixsite.com/homepage).

My current research focuses on circumstellar disk evolution and dispersal due to X-ray photo-evaporation, and dust evolution in protoplanetary discs.

I am also interested in planet formation around binary star systems and on the influence of stellar flybys on the formation and evolution of planetary systems.
